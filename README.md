PROJECT TITLE: SALON APPOINTMENT BOOKING MOBILE APPLICATION.
People go to the salon to get beauty services, but after waiting for a long time they become irritated and begin visiting other salons, which causes the problem of queueing to recur.
It's tiring to wait too long for your time at the salon. The majority of today's women are working professionals who rarely have time on the weekends to visit salons. They definitely don't want to waste time standing in lines waiting for their turn. This online salon booking tool will make salon appointment booking easier for working individuals who don't have a lot of free time. People will be able to book online salon appointments from the comfort of their own homes with only a few clicks on their phones.
